/***********************************************************************************************************
Swap First and Last - Every X 
The program must accept a string S and integer X as the input.
For every X characters in S, the program must swap the first and last character in the X characters.
Finally, the program must print the modified string as the output. Note: The length of S is always divisible by X.
Boundary Condition(s): 
2 <= Length of S <= 10000 
2 <= X <= Length of S 
Input Format:
The first line contains the string S and the integer X separated by a space.
Output Format:
The first line contains the modified string. 
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
tacgod
3
Output:
catdog
Explanation:
The first 3 characters are 't', 'a' and 'c'. After swapping the first and last character, the string becomes "catgod". 
The second 3 characters are 'g', 'o' and 'd'. After swapping the first and last character, the string becomes "catdog".
Hence the output is catdog 
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
oDnwolda
2
Output:
Download
