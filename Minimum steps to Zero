/**************************************************************************************

Minimum Steps to 0
The program must accept two integers N and K as the input.
The program must print the minimum number of steps required to reach 0 from N based on the following steps.
-If N is divisible by K then divide N by k.
-If N is not divisible by K then decrement N by 1. 
Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= N <= 1000
2 <= K <= 1000
Input Format: 
The first line contains the values of N and K separated by a space.
Output Format:
The first line contains the minimum number of steps required to reach 0 from N.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
29 3
Output:
6
Explanation:
29 -> 28 -> 27 -> 9 -> 3 -> 1 -> 0
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
31 2
Output:
9
