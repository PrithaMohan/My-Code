/***********************************************************

Sum without Carry
The program must accept two integers A and B having same number of digits as the input.
The program must add the digits of A and B at same positions without any carry over.
Then the program must print the sum as the output.
Boundary Condition(s): 
1 <= A, B <= 10^8 
Input Format: 
The first line contains the values of A and B separated by a space.
Output Format: 
The first line contains the value of sum based on the given conditions.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
123 219 
Output:
332 
Explanation:
The last digits 3 and 9 are added to get 12. But the carry is not forwarded to the digit so only 2 is printed. The remaining two digits
are added as 2 + 1 = 3 and 1 + 2 = 3. Hence 332 is printed.
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
999 999
Output:
888
