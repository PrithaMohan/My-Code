/******************************************************************************************************

Substring Adjacent Characters
The program must accept two string values S1 and S2 as the input.
The program must form a string by concatenating each character which occurs just before and just after each occurrence of S2 in S1. 
If there is no character before or after S2 then consider only the available character.
If there is only one character between two occurrences of S2 then include the character for twice while forming the string.
Finally, the program must print the string as the output. If there is no such character to form the string then the program must print -1
as the output. 
Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= Length of S1 <= 1000 
1 <= Length of S2 <= Length of S1 
Input Format: 
The first line contains the string S1.
The second line contains the string S2.
Output Format:
The first line contains the string as per the given conditions or -1.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
skllillrallckll 
ll
Output:
kiirack 
Explanation:
There are four occurrences of "ll" in "skllillrallckll".
The character which occurs just before and just after the first occurrence of ll are k and i.
The character which occurs just before and just after the second occurrence of ll are i and r.
The character which occurs just before and just after the third occurrence of ll are a and k. 
The character which occurs just before the fourth occurrence of ll is k. So the string becomes "kiirack". 
Hence the output is kiirack 
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
independence 
defence
Output:
-1
