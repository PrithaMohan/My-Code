/*****************************************************************************************************
Alternate Characters in 
S1 and S2

The program must accept two string values
S1 and S2 as the input. 

The program
must print the first character in S1,
then the program must print the
second character
in
S2
, then the program must print
the third character in S1, then the program must print the fourth character in S2 and so on. 
Note:
Both the string values are always having the same length.
Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= Length of S1 and S2 <= 100 
Input Format:
The first line contains the string S1.
The second line contains the string S2.
Output Format:
The first line contains the modified string.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
lemon
apple
Output:
lpmln
Explanation:
The first character in the sting lemon is l.
The second character in the sting apple is p. The third character in the sting lemon is m.
The fourth character in the string apple is l. The fifth character in the string lemon is n. Hence the output is lpmln 
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
copy
past
Output:
capt
