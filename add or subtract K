/*****************************************************************************
Add or Subtract K
The program must accept N integers and an integer K as the input. For each integer I among the N integers, the program must add K to I if
the unit digit of I and K are equal. Else the program must subtract K from I. Then the program must print the modified integers as the
output.
Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= N <= 100 1 <= Each integer value, K <= 10^7
Input Format:
The first line contains N and K separated by a space. The first line contains N integers separated by a space.
Output Format: 
The first line contains the modified N integers.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
4 32 
22 154 12 11 
Output:
54 122 44 -21
Explanation:
The unit digit of 22 and 32 are equal so they are added and printed 22 + 32 = 54. The unit digit of 154 and 32 are not equal so
they are subtracted and printed 154 - 32 = 122. The unit digit of 12 and 32 are equal so they are added and printed 12 + 32 = 44.
The unit digit of 11 and 32 are not equal so they are subtracted and printed 11 - 32 = -21.
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
6 27
17 500 27 37 106 107 
Output:
44 473 54 64 79 134
