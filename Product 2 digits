/*********************************************************************************************************************
Product - 2 Digits 
The program must accept an integer N as the input.
If the number of digits in N is even then the program must print product of every two digits in N as the output.
If the number of the digits in N is odd then the program must print the product of every two digits in N then it must print the remaining 
digit (last digit) as it is as the output.
Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= N <= 10^15
Input Format:
The first line contains the integer N. 
Output Format:
The first line contains the integers separated by space as per the given condition.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
1234
Output:
2 12 
Explanation:
The number of digits in 1234 is 4 which is even. The product of the first two digits is 2 (1 * 2).
The product of the next two digits is 12 (3 * 4).
Hence the output is 2 12
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
19849 
Output:
9 32 9
