/********
The program must accept a string S as the input. 
The program must find the count of alphabets M which are present between the alphabets a and m (inclusive) in the string S.
Then the program must find the count of alphabets N which are present between the alphabets n and z (inclusive) in the string S.
Finally, the program must print the output based on the following conditions. 
-If M is greater than N then print FIRSTHALF. 
-If N is greater than M then print SECONDHALF.
-If M and N are equal then print -1.

Boundary Condition(s): 
1 <= Length of S <= 100
Input Format: The first line contains the string S.
Output Format: The first line contains FIRSTHALF or SECONDHALF or -1. 
Example Input/Output 1: 
Input:
abcdxyz 
Output: FIRSTHALF 
Explanation: The alphabets a, b, c and d are present between the alphabets a and m.
So their count M is 4. The alphabets x, y and z are present between the alphabets n and z.
So their count N is 3. Here M is greater than N. So FIRSTHALF is printed.
Example Input/Output 2:
Input: zyasnw
Output: SECONDHALF
